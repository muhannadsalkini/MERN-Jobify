// Multer is a popular middleware package for handling multipart/form-data in Node.js web applications. It is commonly used for handling file uploads. Multer simplifies the process of accepting and storing files submitted through HTTP requests by providing an easy-to-use API. It integrates seamlessly with Express.js and allows developers to define upload destinations, file size limits, and other configurations.
